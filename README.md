# Libraries and technologies used.
- Retrofit : Making HTTP connection with the rest API and convert reponse json file to Kotlin/Java object.
- MVVM & LiveData : Saperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.
- Coroutines : Do some code in the background.
- View binding : Instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.
- Dagger 2 : Compile-time framework for dependency injection.
- Glide : Load and cache images by URL.
